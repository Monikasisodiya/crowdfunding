# 🚀 Crowdfunding

## 📘 Project Description
The **Crowdfunding** smart contract is a decentralized fundraising application built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It allows individuals or organizations to raise funds transparently without needing intermediaries. Contributors can send Ether directly to the project, and once the funding goal is achieved, the project owner can withdraw the collected funds.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To build a **trustless and transparent crowdfunding platform** that empowers creators and backers alike.  
By removing centralized authorities and automating fund management, we create a system where contributors can confidently support ideas that matter.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Decentralized Fundraising:** Smart contract ensures full transparency — no third party involved.  
- **Automatic Goal Check:** The owner can withdraw funds only after reaching the goal.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add **refund feature** if the goal isn’t met within a deadline.  
- Support **multiple crowdfunding campaigns** in one contract.

- Implement **time-based campaign deadlines** for automatic goal validation.
